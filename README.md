# Tomography with Algebraic Topology

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze images using **algebraic topology**. The goal is to extract structural information from images through mathematical concepts such as **connected components and loops**.

### Objectives

1. **Transform grayscale images** by applying different thresholds.
2. **Analyze changes in topological structures** as the threshold varies.
3. **Visualize this analysis** through **Beta curves** and **persistence diagrams**.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

| Library | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `opencv-python` | For loading and processing images. |
| `numpy` | For numerical matrix manipulation. |
| `matplotlib` | For visualizing images and graphs. |
| `gudhi` | For topological analysis and persistence diagrams. |

### Installation

You can install all required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib gudhi
```

## Usage

To run the project, simply open the notebook and follow the instructions in the cells. Make sure to have the images in the appropriate folder before executing the code.
